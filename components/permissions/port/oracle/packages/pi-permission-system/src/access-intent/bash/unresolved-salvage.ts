/**
 * Run `use` over the roots of every region the primary parse could not resolve
 * but which re-parses cleanly on its own, then delete the trees it created.
 *
 * `tree-sitter-bash` 0.25.1 cannot parse a heredoc redirect combined with
 * `2>&1` **and** a pipe, though each pairing alone is fine. Its recovery hangs
 * an `ERROR` node holding only the `|` under `heredoc_redirect → file_redirect`
 * and leaves the piped command's words as plain siblings of it — and
 * `heredoc_redirect` is an execution host, descended for the substitutions it
 * may carry and never read for text. So `git commit -F - <<'MSG' 2>&1 | rm -rf
 * /tmp/x` enumerates `git commit -F` and nothing else, and a configured
 * `bash: {"rm -rf *": "deny"}` is never evaluated against a command that
 * really runs (#875).
 *
 * Re-parsing the dropped region's own source text recovers it, because the
 * grammar gap is in the *combination* — `2>&1 | rm -rf /tmp/x` parses
 * perfectly on its own.
 *
 * A heredoc tail the grammar cannot parse at all (`cat <<EOF ; rm -rf x`)
 * leaves no region whose own text re-parses: the innermost unresolved node is
 * the heredoc redirect, whose text fails the same way. So each such heredoc's
 * line is offered too, spelled without its heredoc operators
 * (`heredoc-free-lines.ts`), after the regions.
 *
 * The roots are handed to a callback rather than returned because each belongs
 * to a tree that must outlive its use and be released afterwards, exactly as
 * the primary parse's caller already does for its own tree.
 *
 * Salvaging is purely additive: a caller enumerates these roots *in addition
 * to* the primary one, so the result can only ever be more restrictive.

/**

 *
 * Three exclusions shape the answer.
 *
 * An `ERROR` node is never a candidate and is never descended in search of
 * one: its interior is recovery's invention rather than anything observed
 * (#742), so the region worth re-parsing is the node that *holds* it.
 *
 * Only the innermost such node is offered. An enclosing statement reports the
 * error too, and its text re-parses to the same failure, so offering it
 * salvages nothing while burying the fragment that would have worked.
 *
 * `root` itself is never a candidate, for the same reason taken to its limit:
 * re-parsing the whole source reproduces the whole failure by construction.
