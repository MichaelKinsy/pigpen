/**
 * Grammar-anchored masking of a secret bound to a sensitive name *inside* a
 * bash command string.
 *
 * Key-name redaction (`log-redaction.ts`) masks a value because of the key it
 * is bound to, and a command string is one opaque value under the key
 * `command`. This module asks the same question of the names a command binds
 * values to — a shell variable and an HTTP header field — so one predicate
 * answers for all three binding forms.
 *
 * Every rule matches a **parse node**, never a substring of the command text.
 * That is what keeps it usable: measured against a 12 MB review log (7146
 * unique commands), a raw-string scan for a sensitively-named assignment
 * matched ten commands and every one was embedded Python (`key=lambda x: x[1]`)
 * or a `sed` pattern; the same rule anchored to a `variable_assignment` node
 * matched none. See `docs/decisions/0010-permission-log-secret-exposure.md`.
 *
 * A value with no name bound to it — a secret typed as a `grep` pattern — is
 * out of reach of a structural rule and stays unmasked.
 *
 * An inline-shell payload (`bash -c '…'`, `eval "…"`) is one opaque token to
 * the outer parse, so it is re-parsed on its own and the recovered spans are
 * shifted onto the command as written. The widening is restricted to the
 * payloads the wrapper analyzer already identifies as shell: a heredoc body is
 * not one, and applying these rules to the 915 `<<'EOF'` bodies in the same
 * corpus matched six commands, every one embedded Python or TypeScript written
 * to a file (#923).
