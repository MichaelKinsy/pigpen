 * The Action guard for one session. `evaluateAction` judges a single call; this module owns what spans calls:
 *
 * - **Hold and approval.** After a hold in steer mode, the next guarded call that runs under a *new* user prompt asks Jev
 *   whether that prompt approves it. The retry rarely repeats the held string byte for byte (a `command -v` dropped, a
 *   different timeout), so approval is judged against the action itself, never matched against the earlier command text.
 *   A re-hold under the reply keeps the original reference prompt; otherwise the reply could never approve anything.
 *   Without a judge, a reply that reads as approval stands in for the question.
 * - **Sibling prejudging.** Calls of one assistant message are judged as soon as the first of them is inspected, so their
 *   requests go out together. A judgment is used once and only for the input it was made for; an earlier hook may have
 *   changed the call's input, and a stale judgment is discarded, not reused. Prejudgments do not outlive their turn.
