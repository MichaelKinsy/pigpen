 * The rules check behind `/warden rules check`: two questions about the rule set itself, not about a change.

 * One question asks whether the rules guard can judge a rule correctly from the changed file's content alone. The guard
 * sends the judge a rule, the path of the one file being written, and the text written to it (plus a few lines of that
 * same file around an edit): a rule that needs another file, the history, or the task scores poorly there.
 *
 * The other asks whether a standard linter, formatter, or type checker could enforce the rule exactly, where a request
 * per edit buys nothing over a tool that runs for free and decides the same way every time.
 *
 * Advice only. Nothing here changes, disables, or skips a rule, and the guard's own questions, thresholds, and defaults
 * are untouched. Requests carry each rule's heading, text, and `paths:` scope, redacted; no file content and no task text.
