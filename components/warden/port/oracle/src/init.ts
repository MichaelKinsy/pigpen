A comment states a reason, a constraint, a workaround, or a non-obvious invariant. A comment
that restates what the next line plainly does is a violation.

# Errors are not swallowed
A \`catch\` block must handle the error, report it, or re-raise it. An empty catch block, or
one whose body is only a comment, is a violation.

# No partial implementations
Implement features fully. A comment that says "for now", "simplified", or "later", or a
stub body, is a violation. If a part genuinely cannot be done, say so in your reply instead
of stubbing it.

# Do not run destructive commands that erase uncommitted work
\`git reset --hard\`, \`git checkout -- .\`, \`git clean -fd\`, and similar commands that discard
untracked or uncommitted changes are forbidden. These destroy work that has no backup. If a
clean tree is needed, create a worktree instead or ask the user.
