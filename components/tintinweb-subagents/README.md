# tintinweb-subagents (Go port, partial)

A Go extension for PiG that lets the model hand work to **subagents**, as Claude Code does: the `Agent` tool starts a
specialist (`general-purpose`, `Explore` or `Plan`, or one you define in a Markdown file), by default in the
background; you are notified when it finishes, `get_subagent_result` fetches the full answer, `steer_subagent`
redirects a running one, and `/agents` lists the types and the agents of the session. It is a port of
`@tintinweb/pi-subagents` 0.19.0 by tintinweb (see [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md)), made with the
[extension porting Skill](../extension-port/README.md). It needs no Node runtime, and **starts no process until an
agent is started**.

**This is not [`components/subagents`](../subagents/README.md)**, the port of `nicobailon/pi-subagents`: a different
project with a different tool. The two can be installed side by side.

## Install

```sh
pig install ./components/tintinweb-subagents
```

or take the [`pig-essentials`](../../piglets/pig-essentials/README.md) Piglet, which selects it together with
`tintinweb-tasks`: `TaskExecute` of that port starts its agents through this one, over the same event-bus protocol
(version 2: `subagents:rpc:ping`, `spawn`, `stop`, `consume`, and the `subagents:ready`, `created`, `completed`,
`failed` and `steered` events).

## How an agent runs

Each agent is a child `pig --mode rpc --no-session` process, started in your workspace with the agent's tools and
system prompt, the parent's model and thinking level (unless the call or the agent file sets its own), and the task as
its prompt. The original runs the agent inside Pi's process through Pi's SDK; a Go extension cannot, so an agent here
costs one process (and one start-up of pig). A child registers no agent tools, so there is no nesting. The pig that
is started is, in order: `TINTINWEB_SUBAGENTS_PIG_BINARY`, the pig that started this extension (`PIG_HARNESS_BINARY`,
which PiG sets for its extension processes), the parent process (Linux and Android), this executable (in a Piglet
Binary, the Binary itself, so agents have the same built-in members), `pig` on `PATH`; the first that answers
`--version` is used. The child inherits your environment, so it reads the same credentials and settings.

An agent with a turn limit (`max_turns`, the agent file's `max_turns` or `defaultMaxTurns`) is told to wrap up when it
reaches the limit, and aborted if it is still working `graceTurns` turns later (default 5); it then reports as
`steered` or `aborted`, and a run whose last turn failed (a provider error) reports as an error, as in the original.
Stopping an agent (or ending the session) stops its process group: SIGTERM, then SIGKILL five seconds later.

## Agent files

Custom agents are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter, read from `<agent dir>/agents/`, `<workspace>/.agents/agents/`
and `<workspace>/.pi/agents/` (later ones win), exactly as in the original: `name`, `description`, `tools`
(`all`, `none`, a list, `ext:` selectors), `model`, `thinking`, `max_turns`, `prompt_mode`, `run_in_background`,
`enabled`, `disallowed_tools`, `extensions`, `skills`, `isolated` and the rest are parsed the same way (the 76 cases of
the original's `custom-agents` tests are twinned). Settings come from `<agent dir>/subagents.json` and
`<workspace>/.pi/subagents.json`: `maxConcurrent` (default 10), `defaultMaxTurns`, `graceTurns`, `fallbackSubagent` (an
unknown type goes to `general-purpose`, to a named agent, or with `"none"` is refused) and `disableDefaultAgents`.

## What is not ported

This port ships the slice above. The original's other features are named in [port/slices.json](port/slices.json) and
[port/PORT.md](port/PORT.md): the `SubagentWorkflow` JS workflow runtime, scheduled runs, worktree isolation, `@name`
mentions, the widget, fleet and conversation-viewer UI, persistent agent memory, nested delegation, `inherit_context`
(the call is refused with a message), the settings menu, and output transcripts. `resume` starts a new agent with the
earlier agent's final answer in its prompt (a child's session is not kept). `isolated: true` starts the child with no
extensions. The `Agent` tool is advertised with the original's text and schema as it is with workflows, scheduling and
worktree isolation switched off.

The proof that the shipped slice matches the original is in [port/PORT.md](port/PORT.md).
