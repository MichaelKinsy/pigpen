# Port record: websearch (pi-web-access 0.33.0, first slice)

Original: **pi-web-access 0.33.0** by Nico Bailon (MIT), commit `9a734ed195da2f4cccc2fb5e7128f6774a380f47`, kept
unmodified in [`oracle/`](oracle). Built against **PiG 0.3.0** (Pi 0.87.1 API), on the public Go SDK only.
Credits: [`../CREDITS.md`](../CREDITS.md).

## Status: the first slice, not the whole port

Search, fetch and source retention are ported and twinned. Everything else is a **named skipped test**:
`pigeq twins check --ledger port/upstream-tests.json --go extensions/websearch` accounts for all
875 upstream test titles (305 exact twins, 570 named skips, each with a reason). Do not call this port complete.

| Slice 1 (done) | Deferred (named skips) |
|---|---|
| Tools `web_search` (workflow `none`), `fetch_content` (readable/raw, images), `get_search_content`, `source_check`, `web_enable` and the `/search` command; dynamic activation with transcript-based selection; tool renaming and registration gates; schemas hash-identical to the original | Curator UI and every command but `/search`; `summary-review` / `auto-summary` workflows; fetch `answer` mode and query rewrite (need a model-completion call); activity widget and shortcut; TUI render hooks |
| Providers Exa (keyed and keyless MCP), Brave, Tavily (key pool), Perplexity, DuckDuckGo, SERPdive, Kagi (search); routing (`auto`, `all`, arrays, `searchRouting`, `allowedProviders`), error classification, credential sources | The other 27 providers (OpenAI/Codex hosted search, Gemini, xAI, Jina Search, Firecrawl, ...): in the provider table, they fail with an explicit `unsupported` error and are never a silent fallback |
| SSRF guard, redirect limits, domain policy, proxy scoping, private 0600 fetch cache with TTL, retained sources restored from the session, inline data-URI sanitiser, config loading | PDF text extraction (config is read), YouTube/video/frames, GitHub clone, RSC/Defuddle fallbacks, hosted fetch providers other than Jina, authenticated fetch, Gemini Web and browser cookies |

## Mapping (original file -> Go)

`storage.ts` storage.go - `utils.ts`/`ssrf-protection.ts`/`credential-source.ts` config.go, credential.go, ssrf.go, proxy.go,
transport.go - `gemini-search.ts` (routing) search.go, searchcommon.go - `brave/tavily/perplexity/exa/duckduckgo/serpdive/kagi.ts`
same names - `extract.ts` extract.go, htmlmd.go, imageproc.go, declared_links.go, featureconfig.go - `find`/`source-check`/`fetch-params`
find.go, sourcecheck.go, fetchparams.go - `data-uri-sanitize.ts` datauri.go - `index.ts` tools.go, tool_*.go, toolconfig.go,
schema.go, render.go, command.go, extension.go - `tool-activation.ts` tool_enable.go.

## Deliberate differences

- **HTML to Markdown** uses an `x/net/html` readability-lite and a Turndown-style converter, not Mozilla Readability + Turndown:
  not byte-identical (named gap in the fetch twins). RSC and Defuddle fallbacks return nothing.
- **Provider timeouts** are classified as network errors, so `searchRouting` can fall through; the original treats
  them as aborts. Caller cancellation is still an abort and never falls through.
- **SSRF hardening beyond the original**: the address is checked again when the connection is made (a name that changes
  between validation and connect cannot reach an internal address); IPv6 multicast, NAT64 and 6to4-embedded IPv4 are blocked.
- **Config directory** is PiG-first (`PIG_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, then `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, XDG `pig`, `$PIG_HOME/agent`), with Pi's
  locations as read fallbacks; a new config is written under `$PIG_HOME/agent`.
- **Tool errors**: where the original returns `isError: true` inside the result object (Pi ignores it), PiG marks the result as an
  error, so the model sees `web_enable` failures as failures.
- **Invalid `web-search.json`** makes the original throw at registration; an extension cannot fail its load here, so nothing is
  registered and the problem is shown at session start.
- **A session that cannot be read** (restore or transcript selection) still starts; the user gets a warning.
- **SOCKS4/4a proxies** validate like the original but fail closed at connect (Go's `net/http` has no SOCKS4 dialer).
- **Credential commands** run through the bare `sh` (Go) instead of `/bin/sh`, so the harness can record them and NixOS-style systems work.
- **Guidance names only what this port can do** (review fix): the fetch "Fallback options" checklist and the
  "No search provider available" error of the original also suggest Firecrawl, Crawl4AI, TinyFish, Search1API, Querit,
  Ollama, Parallel, Bright Data, OpenAI/Codex `/login`, the Gemini API and signing into Gemini Web in Chrome. None of
  them works here, so they are left out; the upstream tests only match the headings and the Jina and search bullets.
- **Image pixel budget** (review fix): images larger than 2000 px are decoded for resizing only up to 64 megapixels
  (8192x8192). Go's decoders allocate the full pixel buffer from the declared size, so a few kilobytes of PNG could
  otherwise demand gigabytes and kill the extension process; larger images fail with "Image too large to process".
- Tool schemas are hash-identical to the original's (`tools-default.json` in `golden/`); on the wire the SDK carries them as JSON
  objects, so key order is the SDK's, not the original's.
- The tool descriptions are kept identical to the original even where they mention unported capabilities (YouTube, GitHub,
  PDF, video, Node fetch): the original's own compatibility test pins their hashes.

## Security posture

- SSRF guard on every remote fetch (private, loopback, link-local, multicast, NAT64, 6to4), with redirect limit 5 and per-hop
  re-validation; `ssrf.allowRanges` exempts explicit CIDRs, and requests through a proxy (`proxy`, or the environment
  proxy with `ssrf.trustEnvProxy`) skip the dial-time check (see below).
- **No browser-cookie access**: Chrome/Gemini Web cookie extraction and authenticated fetch are not ported; `auth` profiles
  return an explicit "not available" error.
- **No paid fallback without configuration**: providers with keys are only used when configured; unported providers never run.
- Two defaults send data to third parties (both as in the original): the keyless Exa MCP (`mcp.exa.ai`), which `auto` uses
  when nothing is configured and `exa` uses without a key, and the Jina Reader fetch fallback (off for remote URLs unless `fetchRouting.allowRemoteHostedProviders`).
- Credentials are redacted from every error; the fetch cache is private (0600), symlink-free and size/TTL bounded.
- Size and time limits: page bodies are capped at 5 MB (declared or streamed), provider API bodies at 16 MB, images at
  64 megapixels before decoding, and every direct fetch runs under `fetch.timeout`.
- The `proxy` tool parameter is chosen by the model, as in the original. A request through a proxy is validated by name
  before it is sent, but the dial-time address check does not apply (the proxy connects, not this process), and the proxy
  host itself is not restricted, so a model can route fetches through a proxy on a local address (a call parameter wins
  over `proxy` in `web-search.json`). Open follow-up: an option to ignore the parameter.

## Adapted twins

These upstream cases use a provider that is not ported (OpenAI, XCrawl, AnySearch, SerpBase, Serply) or observe curl; the
behaviour under test is provider-independent, so the case runs with a ported provider (or the proxy the request carries).
Each logs `ADAPTED:` when run.

| Upstream title | Adaptation | Go file |
|---|---|---|
| source_check fetchContent uses the explicit proxy for result pages | provider tavily instead of openai (not ported); recorded proxy of each request instead of curl arguments | `proxy_test.go` |
| fetch_content passes the explicit proxy through queued extraction | the page body is padded past the 500-character usefulness floor: this port's HTML pipeline (like the original's, which also rejects the short fixture body) reports shorter pages as incomplete | `proxy_test.go` |
| configured socks5h proxy is accepted and routed to curl | asserts the accepted proxy the request carries instead of curl arguments | `proxy_test.go` |
| non-curated search stops after caller cancellation | provider tavily instead of anysearch (not ported) | `tools_provider_test.go` |
| web_search and Curator reject disabled providers before availability or requests | only workflow none runs; summary-review is the curator (deferred) | `tools_provider_test.go` |
| allowlisting an explicit-only provider does not opt it into auto or all | duckduckgo instead of serply (not ported); both are explicit-only | `tools_provider_test.go` |
| an allowlisted explicit-only provider remains directly selectable with its credential | duckduckgo (keyless) instead of serply (not ported); credential header check dropped | `tools_provider_test.go` |
| an absent config file preserves registration and search behavior | commands are the ported ones and web_enable is registered (dynamic activation is the default here) | `tools_provider_test.go` |
| source_check executes a successful OpenAI provider response with runtime context | provider tavily instead of openai (not ported) | `tools_provider_test.go` |
| source_check stops on cancellation instead of continuing queries | provider tavily instead of openai (not ported) | `tools_provider_test.go` |
| source_check retains a rejected page fetch in the artifact | provider tavily instead of openai (not ported); the page is an IP literal so no DNS is needed | `tools_provider_test.go` |
| web_search output tells the model the responseId that get_search_content accepts | provider tavily instead of openai (not ported); the identifier flow is provider-independent | `tools_search_test.go` |
| web_search output honours a renamed get_search_content tool | provider tavily instead of openai (not ported); the identifier flow is provider-independent | `tools_search_test.go` |
| web_search output omits the retrieval hint when get_search_content is disabled | provider tavily instead of openai (not ported); the identifier flow is provider-independent | `tools_search_test.go` |
| web_search expands a JSON-array string in query into separate searches | provider brave instead of xcrawl (not ported); query expansion is provider-independent | `tools_search_test.go` |
| web_search keeps mixed JSON arrays in query as a single literal query | provider brave instead of xcrawl (not ported); query expansion is provider-independent | `tools_search_test.go` |
| web_search does not reinterpret already-structured queries entries | provider brave instead of xcrawl (not ported); query expansion is provider-independent | `tools_search_test.go` |
| web_search reports the existing no-query error for empty JSON-array strings | provider brave instead of xcrawl (not ported); query expansion is provider-independent | `tools_search_test.go` |
| web_search bounds batch concurrency and preserves query order | provider brave instead of xcrawl (not ported); the summary-review half runs the curator, a named gap | `tools_search_test.go` |
| web_search preserves OpenAI answers even when no sources are returned | provider tavily instead of openai (not ported) | `tools_search_test.go` |
| default raw multi-query output is bounded, attributed, and stored without mutation | provider tavily (answer text passes through) instead of openai/anysearch (not ported) | `tools_search_test.go` |
| stored search answers support bounded continuation and findText | provider tavily (answer text passes through) instead of openai/anysearch (not ported) | `tools_search_test.go` |
| truncated output discloses disabled retrieval while remaining within the cap | provider tavily (answer text passes through) instead of openai/anysearch (not ported) | `tools_search_test.go` |
| configured inline limit bounds the complete raw presentation | provider tavily (answer text passes through) instead of openai/anysearch (not ported) | `tools_search_test.go` |
| below-minimum inline limit falls back to the default and exact minimum remains complete | provider tavily (answer text passes through) instead of openai/anysearch (not ported) | `tools_search_test.go` |
| truncated inline-ready search retains fetch and search retrieval guidance | provider tavily (answer text passes through) instead of openai/anysearch (not ported) | `tools_search_test.go` |
| truncated background-fetch search retains state, fetchId, and search retrieval guidance | provider tavily (answer text passes through) instead of openai/anysearch (not ported) | `tools_search_test.go` |

## Proof

| Layer | Result |
|---|---|
| Twins | `pigeq twins check`: 305 exact + 570 named skips = 875 titles; exit 0 |
| Go tests | `go test -race -count=24` with `GOMAXPROCS=4` passes; `go vet` clean on linux, windows, darwin |
| Equivalence | 5 scenarios recorded from the original under **Pi 0.87.1** (`golden/`), replayed on PiG with the Go port: identical traces (`pigeq check --go`). They cover registration, schemas, system-prompt snippets, dynamic activation, renaming and the tool gates. Scenarios that need a fake server's URL in a tool call or a stable `responseId` are in `scenarios-pending/` |
| Mutation | `mutations.json`: 15 mutants, all killed (`pigeq mutate --unit`) |
| Binary | a Piglet Binary with only this extension fused (a temporary Piglet, deleted after the run) builds with PiG 0.3.0 and passes the process-global safety check; replaying the 5 scenarios on it (`pigeq record --self --builtin`) gives tool results and events identical to the Pi golden traces. `pig-with-batteries` itself cannot build a Binary yet because of the Node herdr extension (documented in its README) |
| Go tests | 477 passing subtests, 572 skipped (570 ledger skips + 2 environment skips), coverage 86% |

## Notes for PiG 0.4.0 (Pi 0.99.1)

- Re-check `toolsAdded`/`toolsRemoved` system messages in `BuildSessionContext` (transcript-based activation depends on them) and the
  tool activation API.
- `sdk.ToolResult.Content` is one string: several text blocks are joined with a blank line; a structured content array would
  remove that.
- The SDK `Schema` is a `map`, so schema key order is not preserved.
- `Context` stays valid after its request completes (used for background-fetch messages); keep that guarantee.
- The template fake host's `Command` helper sends the command name in `args` where the SDK reads `tool`; arrays cannot be
  answered by `OnCall`. Both are known issues of the template (`components/extension-port`).
