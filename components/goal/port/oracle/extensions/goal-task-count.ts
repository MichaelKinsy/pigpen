/**
 * Single task-counting implementation (P1-10).
 *
 * Previously ~5 copies of the same subtree walker lived in goal-policy,
 * goal-auditor, widgets/goal-widget, widgets/task-list-overlay, and
 * prompts/goal-prompts, with subtly different shapes. All call sites now use
 * this one walker. `doneIncludesSkipped` is explicit so "skipped counts as
 * done" semantics can never drift silently again: today every call site uses
 * false (skipped is tracked separately, matching prior behavior); the flag
 * exists for surfaces that deliberately want skipped folded into done.
