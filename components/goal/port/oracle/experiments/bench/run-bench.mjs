/**
 * Benchmark orchestrator (B9 emitter + B8 assertion).
 *
 * Runs B1, B3, B2, B4, B5, B7 over the real extension functions with the
 * agent-free guard active, then writes (per campaign, see campaigns.mjs):
 *   experiments/bench/<prefix><phase>.json           (raw rows)
 *   specs/<campaign-spec-dir>/BENCH-<PHASE>.md       (human table)
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node --import experiments/bench/bench-adapter-hooks.mjs \
 *        --experimental-strip-types experiments/bench/run-bench.mjs before [campaign]
 *   ... same with "after" once the optimisations land.
 *
 * Campaign (optional positional, default "extension-review-plan"): the
 * before/after cycle to emit into. Each campaign writes its own spec-dir
 * BENCH-<PHASE>.md and JSON prefix (see campaigns.mjs) so campaigns never
 * clobber each other's committed artifacts.
 *
 * Agent-free guarantee (B8): the adapter stubs the pi packages (no live
 * agents; createAgentSession throws), shadows node:fs for counting + latency,
 * and forbids node:net/http/https/child_process use. assertNoViolations()
 * fails the run if any of those were touched.
